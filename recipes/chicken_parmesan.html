    <h2>Description</h2>
    <strong>Chicken Parmesan</strong>, also known as Chicken Parmigiana, is an
    Italian-American dish featuring breaded and fried chicken cutlets. These
    thin chicken pieces are coated in a mixture of breadcrumbs and Parmesan
    cheese, then topped with marinara sauce and melted cheese. The dish is often
    baked until the cheese is bubbly and golden. Served over pasta or enjoyed on
    its own, Chicken Parmesan is a classic comfort food, known for its
    satisfying combination of crispy chicken and savory tomato-cheese goodness.
