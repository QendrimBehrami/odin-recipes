    <h2>Description</h2>
    A <strong>Potato Casserole</strong> is a hearty and comforting dish made
    with layers of thinly sliced or diced potatoes, often combined with other
    ingredients such as cheese, cream, butter, and various seasonings. The dish
    is typically baked until the potatoes are tender, and the top is golden and
    crispy.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>

        fresh herbs (parsley, chives), or crispy bacon bits

      </ul>

          Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes or
          until the top is golden brown, and the potatoes are tender.

      </ul>
